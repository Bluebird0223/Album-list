# Features
## Fetch and show albums from the api - https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums
## Add an album, make a POST call to the above url (from where you are fetching) and save the album in react state. (This will be a dummy ## request, you wonâ€™t be able to add albums to the server. But the request is valid and will send you some data. Read the guide).
## Update the album, make a PUT call to the above url. (Again this is a dummy call).
## Delete an album, make a DELETE call to the above url. (Again this is a dummy call).
